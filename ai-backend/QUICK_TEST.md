# ðŸ§ª Quick FLUX Test Guide

## Current Issue
The FLUX generation is working but timing out due to model download and processing time.

## Quick Fixes Applied
1. âœ… Extended frontend timeout to 15 minutes
2. âœ… Reduced FLUX steps from 30 to 20 for faster generation
3. âœ… Added better logging to track progress
4. âœ… Fixed the prompt to be FLUX-Kontext specific

## Test Steps

### 1. Start the Backend
```bash
cd ai-backend
./start_flux.sh
```

### 2. Test Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:8003/health
```
Should return: `{"status":"healthy","models_loaded":true}`

### 3. Test with Simple Generation
Open another terminal and test with a simple curl:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8003/test-generate" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### 4. Monitor Backend Logs
Watch the backend terminal for progress. First generation will:
- Download models (~5-10 minutes)
- Generate image (~2-3 minutes)
- Total: ~8-13 minutes

### 5. Subsequent Generations
After the first generation, subsequent ones should be much faster (~2-3 minutes).

## Expected Behavior

**First time:**
- Models download automatically (no token needed)
- Takes 8-13 minutes total
- Models cached in `~/.cache/huggingface/hub/`

**After first time:**
- Uses cached models
- Takes 2-3 minutes per generation
- Much faster subsequent generations

## If Still Timing Out

Try increasing steps gradually:
- Start with 4 steps (fastest, lower quality)
- Then 10 steps (good balance)
- Finally 20 steps (better quality)

The frontend will wait up to 15 minutes now, which should be enough after models are downloaded.
