# 🦴 Bones System Activation Guide

## ✅ Current Status

**Build Status**: ✅ **SUCCESSFUL** - All build errors are now fixed!
**Art Styles**: ✅ **OPTIMIZED** - All prompts updated for better results  
**Bones System**: ⚠️ **READY TO ACTIVATE** - Database setup required

## 🚀 Quick Activation Steps

### Step 1: Set Up Supabase Database (Required)

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**: https://eefoxylchsfaoglxwhkm.supabase.co
2. **Open SQL Editor** (left sidebar)  
3. **Copy ALL content** from `SUPABASE_SETUP.sql` (234 lines)
4. **Paste and Run** the SQL in the editor
5. **Verify**: Check that `user_bones` and `shared_images` tables were created

### Step 2: Test the System

After running the SQL:

1. **Restart your development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test the bones flow**:
   - ✅ Generate an image
   - ✅ Look for bones counter in header (should show 0)
   - ✅ Click "分享" (Share) button  
   - ✅ Should get 1 bone reward + link copied
   - ✅ Click "视频" (Video) button
   - ✅ Should consume 1 bone and generate video

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Before Database Setup:
- ❌ Bones counter shows 0 (fallback mode)
- ❌ Share buttons don't award bones
- ❌ Video generation works but no bone consumption

### After Database Setup:
- ✅ **Bones counter works** - Shows real count in header
- ✅ **Daily share rewards** - 1 bone per day for sharing
- ✅ **Video generation costs** - 1 bone per video  
- ✅ **Public share links** - `/share/abc123` pages work
- ✅ **Database persistence** - Data saved between sessions

## 🔧 Technical Details

**What's Working Now**:
- ✅ Build succeeds without errors
- ✅ App runs with bones system in fallback mode
- ✅ All art style prompts optimized  
- ✅ Video generation with new endpoints
- ✅ Share/video buttons on all images

**What Needs Database**:
- 🦴 Persistent bone counting
- 📊 Share link analytics
- 🎁 Daily reward limitations
- 👥 Multi-user bone tracking

## 🐛 If You See Issues

**"supabaseUrl is required" Error**:
- ✅ **FIXED** - Fallback system now handles this

**Video generation still uses demo**:
- ✅ **FIXED** - Updated to correct endpoints and model ID

**Art styles look wrong**:
- ✅ **FIXED** - All prompts optimized with Chinese keywords

## 🚀 Ready to Go!

The system is now **production-ready** with:
- ✅ Stable build process
- ✅ Graceful error handling  
- ✅ Optimized art generation
- ✅ Complete bones system (just needs database)

**Next Step**: Run the SQL setup and enjoy the full bones system! 🎉
